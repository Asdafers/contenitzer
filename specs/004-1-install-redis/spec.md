# Feature Specification: Development Environment Setup & Testing

**Feature Branch**: `004-1-install-redis`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: " 1. Install Redis: redis-server for local development
  2. Start Services: Backend (uv run python main.py) + Frontend (npm run dev)
  3. Environment Setup: Configure .env with Redis URL and API keys
  4. Run Tests: Execute contract tests to validate implementation
  5. Validate Workflows: Use quickstart scenarios for end-to-end testing"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Identified: development environment setup and testing validation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: developers, system administrators
   ’ Actions: install, configure, test, validate
   ’ Data: Redis configuration, API keys, test results
   ’ Constraints: local development environment
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All aspects clearly defined in user input
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear setup and validation flow provided
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focused on setup and testing capability
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Configuration files, service processes, test results
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details, focused on setup requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Content Creator Workbench project, I need to set up a complete local development environment with Redis infrastructure and validate that all implemented features work correctly through automated tests and manual workflow validation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh development machine, **When** following setup instructions, **Then** Redis server must be running and accessible locally
2. **Given** Redis is installed, **When** backend and frontend services are started, **Then** both services must connect successfully and be ready for development
3. **Given** services are running, **When** environment variables are configured, **Then** all API integrations must authenticate successfully
4. **Given** environment is configured, **When** contract tests are executed, **Then** all implemented API endpoints must pass validation
5. **Given** tests pass, **When** running quickstart scenarios, **Then** complete workflows must execute successfully end-to-end

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Redis server is not running during service startup?
- How does system handle missing or invalid API keys in environment configuration?
- What occurs when contract tests fail due to implementation issues?
- How are network connectivity issues handled during service startup?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide clear instructions for installing Redis server on local development machines
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable developers to start backend and frontend services with simple commands
- **FR-003**: System MUST guide developers through environment variable configuration including Redis URLs and API keys
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide executable contract tests that validate all implemented API endpoints
- **FR-005**: System MUST include quickstart scenarios for end-to-end workflow validation
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect and report service connectivity issues during startup
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that Redis connection is established before proceeding with tests
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear error messages when setup steps fail
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow developers to verify that session management and task queuing work correctly
- **FR-010**: System MUST enable validation of real-time WebSocket functionality through test scenarios

### Key Entities
- **Redis Server**: Local Redis instance providing session storage and task queuing capabilities
- **Backend Service**: FastAPI application with WebSocket support and Redis integration
- **Frontend Service**: React development server with real-time UI components
- **Environment Configuration**: Collection of environment variables for API keys and service URLs
- **Contract Tests**: Automated test suite validating API endpoint implementations
- **Quickstart Scenarios**: Manual validation workflows demonstrating complete feature functionality
