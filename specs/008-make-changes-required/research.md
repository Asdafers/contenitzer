# Research: Frontend Gemini Model Integration

## Overview
Research findings for integrating frontend React application with the new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image backend APIs, including UI patterns, API integration approaches, and user experience considerations.

## Key Decisions

### API Client Architecture
- **Decision**: Extend existing axios-based API client with new Gemini model endpoints
- **Rationale**: Maintains consistency with existing codebase, leverages existing error handling and interceptors
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Create separate Gemini API client - rejected due to code duplication
  - Use fetch API directly - rejected due to loss of existing middleware

### UI Component Strategy
- **Decision**: Create reusable component library for AI model selection and status display
- **Rationale**: Components will be used across multiple screens, promotes consistency and maintainability
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Inline forms in each page - rejected due to code duplication
  - Third-party AI model selector - rejected due to customization needs

### State Management Approach
- **Decision**: Use React hooks and context for AI model preferences and health status
- **Rationale**: Aligns with existing frontend architecture, no additional dependencies
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Redux for model state - rejected as overkill for this scope
  - Local component state only - rejected due to need for cross-component sharing

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- **Decision**: Implement feature flags to gradually transition from old to new API format
- **Rationale**: Allows safe rollout and rollback capability without breaking existing workflows
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Hard cutover - rejected due to risk of breaking existing users
  - Maintain dual APIs - rejected due to maintenance overhead

### Error Handling Patterns
- **Decision**: Implement graceful degradation with clear user messaging for model unavailability
- **Rationale**: AI models can be temporarily unavailable, users need clear feedback and alternatives
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Silent failures - rejected due to poor user experience
  - Hard errors - rejected due to workflow disruption

## Technical Requirements Resolution

### React Component Patterns
- **Resolved**: Use compound components pattern for model selector with health indicator
- **Implementation**: ModelSelector.Root, ModelSelector.Option, ModelSelector.HealthBadge components

### TypeScript Interface Updates
- **Resolved**: Create new interfaces matching backend API contracts while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Implementation**: Gradual migration from old to new interfaces with union types during transition

### User Experience Flow
- **Resolved**: Integrate model selection into existing media generation workflow with minimal disruption
- **Implementation**: Add model selection as optional step in current forms, default to optimal settings

### Real-time Health Updates
- **Resolved**: Use polling mechanism for model health status with exponential backoff
- **Implementation**: Custom React hook with WebSocket fallback for real-time updates

### Responsive Design Considerations
- **Resolved**: Ensure model selection UI works across desktop and mobile viewports
- **Implementation**: Use Tailwind responsive classes and mobile-first approach

## Integration Points

### Existing API Service
- Extend `apiClient` class with new model-aware endpoints
- Update TypeScript interfaces in `services/api.ts`
- Maintain existing error handling and timeout patterns

### Media Generation Workflow
- Update media generation forms to include model selection
- Enhance progress tracking to show model information
- Add fallback indicators in job status displays

### Asset Management Views
- Extend asset detail views with model metadata
- Add filtering by model used in asset lists
- Include model information in asset export functionality

### User Preferences System
- Integrate model preferences with existing user settings
- Add model selection defaults to user profile
- Implement preference persistence in localStorage

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: API Interface Updates
- Update TypeScript interfaces to match new backend contracts
- Implement new API methods alongside existing ones
- Add feature flags for progressive rollout

### Phase 2: UI Component Development
- Create model selection components with health indicators
- Implement status display components for real-time feedback
- Build asset metadata components for model information

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
- Integrate components into existing workflows
- Test backward compatibility scenarios
- Validate error handling and edge cases

### Phase 4: Progressive Rollout
- Enable features for internal testing
- Gradual rollout to user segments
- Monitor performance and error rates

## Risk Mitigation

### API Breaking Changes
- **Risk**: Backend API changes could break frontend integration
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and contract tests

### User Experience Regression
- **Risk**: New UI complexity could confuse existing users
- **Mitigation**: Provide sensible defaults and progressive disclosure of advanced options

### Performance Impact
- **Risk**: Additional API calls for health checking could slow down UI
- **Mitigation**: Implement intelligent caching and background refresh patterns

### Browser Compatibility
- **Risk**: New features might not work in older browsers
- **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement and graceful fallbacks for unsupported features

## Success Metrics

### Functional
- All API endpoints return expected response formats
- UI components display model information correctly
- Error states handled gracefully with clear messaging

### Performance
- API response times remain under defined thresholds
- UI interactions maintain <100ms response times
- Bundle size increase stays under 200KB

### User Experience
- Users can successfully select preferred models
- Model health information is clearly communicated
- Existing workflows continue to function without disruption
