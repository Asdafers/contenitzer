# Feature Specification: Frontend Gemini Model Integration

**Feature Branch**: `008-make-changes-required`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "make changes required to cover this - Ï The frontend is NOT integrated with the new Gemini enabled flow. Here's what I found:

  Current Frontend API Interface:
  export interface MediaGenerateRequest {
    script_id: string;  // Old format - still expects script_id
  }

  export interface MediaGenerateResponse {
    project_id: string; // Old format - returns project_id
    status: string;
  }

  New Backend API (Gemini-enabled):
  // What the backend now expects:
  {
    script_content: string;
    asset_types: ["image", "video_clip"];
    num_assets?: number;
    preferred_model?: "gemini-2.5-flash-image";
    allow_fallback?: boolean;
  }

  // What it returns:
  {
    job_id: string;
    status: string;
    model_selected: string;
    estimated_completion?: string;
  }

  Missing Frontend Integration:
  - L No model selection UI
  - L No fallback options
  - L No model health checking display
  - L No asset metadata showing which model was used
  - L Still uses old API contract format

  To fully integrate, the frontend needs:
  1. Update MediaGenerateRequest interface
  2. Add model selection components
  3. Add model health status display
  4. Update media generation forms
  5. Show model metadata in asset views

  The frontend is running but needs updates to use the new Gemini features! ='"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator using the platform, I want to generate media assets with advanced AI model options so that I can produce higher quality content with transparency about which AI model was used and have fallback options when the primary model is unavailable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm on the media generation page, **When** I select a preferred AI model and enable fallback options, **Then** the system should generate media using my preferred model or automatically fall back to an alternative if the primary is unavailable
2. **Given** I'm viewing generated assets, **When** I inspect asset details, **Then** I should see which AI model was used for generation and whether fallback occurred
3. **Given** I'm on the platform dashboard, **When** I check system status, **Then** I should see the current health and availability of different AI models
4. **Given** I'm creating a new media generation job, **When** I input script content directly instead of referencing existing scripts, **Then** the system should process the content and generate appropriate media assets
5. **Given** a media generation job is in progress, **When** I check the job status, **Then** I should see progress updates, selected model information, and estimated completion time

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all AI models are temporarily unavailable during generation?
- How does the system handle when a user's preferred model becomes unavailable mid-generation?
- What information is displayed when asset metadata is incomplete or corrupted?
- How does the interface respond when model health checks fail or timeout?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to select their preferred AI model (gemini-2.5-flash-image or gemini-pro) when creating media generation requests
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide toggle option for users to enable or disable automatic fallback to alternative models
- **FR-003**: System MUST display real-time health status of available AI models including availability and response times
- **FR-004**: System MUST accept script content directly in media generation forms instead of requiring pre-existing script references
- **FR-005**: System MUST show which AI model was used for each generated asset in asset detail views
- **FR-006**: System MUST indicate whether fallback model was used during asset generation
- **FR-007**: System MUST display job progress with model selection information and estimated completion times
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle media generation requests with asset type specifications (image, video_clip)
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to specify the number of assets to generate per request
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide visual indicators when AI models are experiencing issues or reduced availability
- **FR-011**: System MUST update user interface elements to use new job-based workflow instead of project-based workflow
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility for users with existing workflows while transitioning to new model selection features

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Media Generation Request**: User input containing script content, preferred model selection, asset types, quantity, and fallback preferences
- **AI Model Status**: Real-time information about model availability, health metrics, and performance indicators
- **Generation Job**: Tracking entity for media creation tasks with model selection, progress, and completion status
- **Asset Metadata**: Extended information about generated media including model used, fallback status, generation timing, and quality metrics
- **Model Selection Preferences**: User's saved preferences for AI model choices and fallback behavior
