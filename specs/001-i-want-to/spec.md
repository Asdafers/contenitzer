# Feature Specification: Content Creator Workbench

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a web applicaiton that will be a content creators workbench. It must have all these functions: 1) be able to get the most watched content on youtube, weekly and monthly; 2) Once it has the list it should pick 3 most popular themes or topics and create a script for a video that is at least 3 minutes long; 3) Once the script is ready it should use gemini APIs to connect to the appropriate AI model to generate the audio version of the script (make it conversational, between two people) and then generate enough images and short videos to work as background; 5) Once all the constituent parts are ready (voiceover/conversation and visuals) the application should put all of them together into a single video and upload it to my youtube account"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extracted: automated content creation workflow for YouTube creators
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: content creators, YouTube users
   ’ Actions: analyze trends, generate scripts, create media, compose videos, upload
   ’ Data: YouTube analytics, scripts, audio files, images, videos
   ’ Constraints: minimum 3-minute duration, conversational format
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: YouTube API access scope and rate limits]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Gemini API usage limits and costs]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Video quality and resolution requirements]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: analyze ’ script ’ generate ’ compose ’ upload
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement testable and specific to user needs
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Trending topics, scripts, media assets, composed videos
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding API limitations"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a content creator, I want an automated workbench that analyzes trending YouTube content and creates complete videos for me, so I can consistently produce relevant content without spending hours on research, scripting, and production.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system is running, **When** I request trending analysis, **Then** the system provides the top 3 most popular themes from the most watched YouTube content in the specified timeframe
2. **Given** trending themes are identified, **When** the system generates a script, **Then** it creates a conversational script between two people that is at least 3 minutes long
3. **Given** a script is ready, **When** the system generates media assets, **Then** it produces conversational audio and supporting visual content (images and short videos)
4. **Given** all media components are ready, **When** the system composes the final video, **Then** it creates a complete video with synchronized audio and visuals
5. **Given** a final video is composed, **When** I authorize upload, **Then** the system successfully uploads the video to my YouTube account

### Edge Cases
- What happens when YouTube trending data is unavailable or limited?
- How does the system handle script generation failure for obscure topics?
- What occurs when media generation produces inappropriate or low-quality content?
- How does the system respond to YouTube upload failures or account restrictions?

## Requirements
