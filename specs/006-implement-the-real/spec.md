# Feature Specification: Real Video Generation Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `006-implement-the-real`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement the real video generation capabilities - From the completed task logs, your video was successfully created with these specifications:

  - Video ID: 6c291407-d84b-468f-85e4-f9e700dde01b
  - Title: \"Generated Video Content\"
  - URL: /media/videos/final_video.mp4
  - Duration: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
  - Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
  - File Size: 245MB
  - Format: MP4
  - Composition Time: 6.5 seconds

  =§ Current Status: Mock Implementation

  Important: This is currently a simulation for development purposes. The system:
  -  Successfully demonstrates the complete workflow automation
  -  Shows realistic progress tracking and timing
  -  Generates proper task metadata and results
  - =§ But doesn't create actual video files yet

  = Next Steps for Real Video Generation

  To make this generate actual videos, you would need to:

  1. Replace mock data in backend/src/tasks/media_tasks.py with real video processing
  2. Add actual media generation (images, audio, video clips)
  3. Integrate video composition library (like FFmpeg, MoviePy, etc.)
  4. Create media storage directory structure
  5. Add video serving endpoint to access generated files

  The workflow automation is now complete and working perfectly! The system successfully:
  -  Handles script upload and validation
  -  Automatically progresses from media generation to video composition
  -  Provides real-time progress updates via WebSocket
  -  Completes the full pipeline with proper task management"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A content creator uploads a script and expects the system to generate a complete video file that they can download, share, or use for their content. Currently, the system simulates this process but produces no actual video output. Users need the system to create real video files with the specified characteristics (duration, resolution, format) that can be accessed and used.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a script has been uploaded and processed through the current workflow, **When** the video generation task completes, **Then** a real MP4 video file must be created at the specified location and be accessible for download
2. **Given** the video generation process is running, **When** a user checks the progress, **Then** they should see real-time updates reflecting actual media generation and composition progress
3. **Given** a video has been successfully generated, **When** a user accesses the video URL, **Then** they should be able to stream or download the actual video file
4. **Given** the system encounters an error during real video generation, **When** the process fails, **Then** the user should receive clear error messages and the system should clean up any partial files

### Edge Cases
- What happens when video generation runs out of storage space during composition?
- How does the system handle corrupted or invalid media assets during generation?
- What occurs if the video composition process is interrupted or crashes mid-generation?
- How does the system manage concurrent video generation requests that might exceed system resources?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate actual video files instead of mock data when video generation tasks are executed
- **FR-002**: System MUST create video files with specified characteristics (1920x1080 resolution, MP4 format, specified duration)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a storage directory structure where generated video files are saved and organized
- **FR-004**: System MUST serve generated video files through accessible URLs for streaming and download
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate or source actual media assets (images, audio, video clips) for video composition
- **FR-006**: System MUST compose individual media assets into final video format using video processing capabilities
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain progress tracking accuracy during real video generation processes
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle file cleanup and storage management for generated videos
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that generated video files meet specified quality and format requirements
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide error handling for video generation failures with appropriate user feedback
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to access generated videos through the provided URLs within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: timeframe not specified - immediate, minutes, hours?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure video generation performance meets [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance targets not specified - max generation time, concurrent users?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Generated Video**: Physical video file with metadata including file path, size, duration, resolution, format, creation timestamp, and generation status
- **Media Assets**: Individual components used in video composition including images, audio clips, video segments, with source information and processing status
- **Video Generation Job**: Process record tracking video creation from initiation through completion, including progress stages, resource usage, and success/failure status
- **Media Storage**: File system organization for storing generated videos and intermediate assets, with cleanup policies and access permissions
