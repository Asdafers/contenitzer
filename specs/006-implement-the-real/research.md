# Research: Real Video Generation Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Context**: Transform mock video generation system to create actual video files

## Technical Unknowns Research

### 1. Video Generation Performance Targets

**Decision**: Target <60 seconds for 3-minute video generation
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for automated video generation is 20:1 to 60:1 real-time ratio
- 3-minute video in <60 seconds provides good user experience
- Allows for concurrent processing on typical server hardware

**Alternatives considered**:
- Real-time generation: Too resource intensive
- Longer processing times: Poor user experience

### 2. Video Processing Library Integration

**Decision**: Use ffmpeg-python wrapper for video composition
**Rationale**:
- Already included in project dependencies (backend/pyproject.toml:16)
- Mature, stable, and feature-complete
- Python wrapper provides good abstraction
- Supports all required formats and codecs

**Alternatives considered**:
- MoviePy: Simpler API but slower performance and memory usage
- OpenCV: More complex integration, primarily for computer vision
- Direct FFmpeg subprocess calls: Less maintainable, error-prone

### 3. Media Asset Generation Approach

**Decision**: Hybrid approach - Generated + Stock assets
**Rationale**:
- Generated text overlays and transitions for personalization
- Stock background images/videos for quality and speed
- Text-to-speech for voiceovers where appropriate
- Reduces generation time while maintaining quality

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fully generated assets: Too slow and quality concerns
- Stock assets only: Limited personalization
- AI-generated only: Resource intensive, unpredictable quality

### 4. Storage Architecture

**Decision**: Hierarchical file storage with cleanup policies
**Rationale**:
```
media/
├── videos/           # Final generated videos
├── assets/
│   ├── images/       # Generated/processed images
│   ├── audio/        # Audio tracks and voiceovers
│   └── temp/         # Temporary composition files
└── stock/            # Reusable stock assets
```
- Organized by type for efficient access
- Temporary files cleanup after successful generation
- Stock assets cached for reuse across generations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Flat storage: Poor organization and cleanup
- Database blob storage: Performance overhead for large files
- Cloud storage: Added complexity and dependency

### 5. Error Handling and Recovery

**Decision**: Transactional approach with cleanup on failure
**Rationale**:
- Track all generated files during process
- On failure, clean up partial assets automatically
- Preserve debug information for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation where possible

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual cleanup: Risk of orphaned files
- No cleanup: Storage bloat over time
- Retry mechanisms: Complex state management

### 6. Video Serving Strategy

**Decision**: Direct file serving through FastAPI static files
**Rationale**:
- Simple implementation using existing FastAPI static file handling
- No additional infrastructure required
- Suitable for expected scale and usage patterns
- Easy to migrate to CDN if needed later

**Alternatives considered**:
- Streaming server: Overkill for generated content
- CDN integration: Premature optimization
- Database storage: Poor performance for large files

### 7. Progress Tracking Integration

**Decision**: Extend existing WebSocket progress system
**Rationale**:
- System already has progress tracking for media generation tasks
- WebSocket infrastructure exists and works well
- Minimal changes to existing progress reporting
- Real-time updates enhance user experience

**Alternatives considered**:
- New progress system: Unnecessary duplication
- Polling-based: Less responsive user experience
- No progress tracking: Poor UX for long operations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase Approach
1. **File Storage Setup**: Create directory structure and cleanup utilities
2. **Media Asset Generation**: Implement image, audio, and text generation
3. **Video Composition**: Integrate FFmpeg for final video assembly
4. **File Serving**: Add endpoints for video access and download
5. **Progress Integration**: Enhance existing progress tracking with real metrics

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with simple compositions and gradually add complexity
- Implement comprehensive error handling and cleanup
- Use existing task infrastructure to maintain reliability
- Add monitoring for file system usage and performance

## Technology Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **Celery Tasks**: Extend media_tasks.py with real implementations
- **Progress Service**: Enhance with file-based progress tracking
- **WebSocket Events**: Add new event types for video generation stages
- **Database Models**: Extend with file path and metadata tracking

### New Components
- **Media Generators**: Image/audio/text generation utilities
- **Video Compositor**: FFmpeg integration wrapper
- **Storage Manager**: File organization and cleanup utilities
- **Asset Validator**: Quality and format verification

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Management
- Process videos sequentially to avoid resource contention
- Implement queue limits for concurrent generation
- Monitor disk space and implement cleanup policies
- Add resource usage monitoring

### Optimization Opportunities
- Cache commonly used stock assets
- Reuse generated assets across similar requests
- Implement progressive quality (start fast, enhance later)
- Consider GPU acceleration for complex compositions

## Validation Approach

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each media generation component
- Integration tests for full video generation pipeline
- Performance tests for generation time and quality
- Error handling tests for failure scenarios

### Quality Assurance
- Automated validation of generated video properties
- Visual quality checks for common video issues
- Audio quality and synchronization verification
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
