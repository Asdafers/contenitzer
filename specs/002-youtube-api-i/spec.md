# Feature Specification: Enhanced Content Creator Workbench with Flexible Input Options

**Feature Branch**: `002-youtube-api-i`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "youtube api: I can provide the required keys; if access to these statistics is not available the application should allow to input the subject or even the script; gemini API - no limits on usage at this stage, I will manage billing manually; content filtering - no filtering; add ability to extract types or groups of content and get top three across top 5 categories if possible"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extracted: Enhanced workbench with fallback options and category-based analysis
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: content creators with YouTube API access
   ’ Actions: analyze by categories, manual input fallback, unrestricted content generation
   ’ Data: YouTube API keys, categorized content analysis, manual subjects/scripts
   ’ Constraints: top 3 across top 5 categories, no content filtering
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All previous clarifications addressed by user input
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow with both automated and manual input paths
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement testable and accounts for fallback scenarios
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Content categories, fallback inputs, unrestricted generation
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All uncertainties resolved by user clarifications
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a content creator, I want a flexible workbench that can automatically analyze YouTube content by categories or accept manual input when needed, generating complete videos without content restrictions, so I can produce relevant content efficiently regardless of API availability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** YouTube API access is available, **When** I request trend analysis, **Then** the system extracts content types/groups and provides top 3 themes across the top 5 categories
2. **Given** YouTube API access is unavailable, **When** I need to create content, **Then** the system allows me to manually input a subject or complete script
3. **Given** I provide a manual subject, **When** the system processes it, **Then** it generates a script and proceeds with the normal workflow
4. **Given** I provide a complete script, **When** the system processes it, **Then** it skips script generation and proceeds directly to audio and visual creation
5. **Given** content is generated, **When** the system creates media, **Then** it produces content without any filtering restrictions
6. **Given** all components are ready, **When** the system composes the video, **Then** it creates a complete video and uploads it to my YouTube account

### Edge Cases
- What happens when YouTube API keys are invalid or expired?
- How does the system handle manual script input that's too short for the 3-minute requirement?
- What occurs when category analysis returns fewer than 5 categories?
- How does the system respond when manual subject input is too vague or broad?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept user-provided YouTube API keys for content analysis
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze YouTube content by extracting types or groups of content
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify top 3 themes across the top 5 content categories when API access is available
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide manual input option for subjects when YouTube API access is unavailable
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide manual input option for complete scripts when YouTube API access is unavailable
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate scripts from manual subject inputs using the same quality standards as automated analysis
- **FR-007**: System MUST skip script generation when users provide complete scripts and proceed directly to media creation
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate content without any filtering or content restrictions
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure all generated scripts (automated or from manual subjects) result in at least 3-minute videos
- **FR-010**: System MUST convert scripts into conversational audio between two people
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate supporting visual content including images and short video clips
- **FR-012**: System MUST compose final videos by synchronizing audio with visual assets
- **FR-013**: System MUST upload completed videos to the user's YouTube account
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide clear feedback when switching between automated and manual input modes
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate manual script inputs for minimum length requirements
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle Gemini API usage without usage restrictions during this phase

### Key Entities
- **Content Categories**: Groups or types of YouTube content used for categorized analysis
- **API Credentials**: User-provided YouTube API keys for accessing trending data
- **Manual Subject**: User-provided topic or theme when automated analysis is unavailable
- **Manual Script**: Complete user-provided script that bypasses automated generation
- **Category Analysis**: Results showing top 3 themes across top 5 content categories
- **Fallback Mode**: System state when operating with manual inputs instead of API data
- **Unrestricted Content**: Generated media without filtering or content moderation
- **Enhanced Workflow**: Process flow that accommodates both automated and manual input paths
