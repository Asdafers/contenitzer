# Research: Script Upload Option

## Overview
Research findings for implementing script upload functionality to bypass YouTube research and script generation phases.

## Key Research Areas

### 1. File Upload Patterns in FastAPI/React
**Decision**: Use multipart form upload with text/plain content-type for script content
**Rationale**:
- Standard web pattern for content upload
- FastAPI has built-in multipart support
- React file upload is straightforward with FormData
- Allows for both file upload and textarea input methods
**Alternatives considered**:
- Base64 encoding (rejected: unnecessary complexity for plain text)
- WebSocket streaming (rejected: overkill for single script upload)

### 2. Workflow Integration Points
**Decision**: Add workflow mode selection at start of content creation process
**Rationale**:
- Cleanest UX - user chooses path upfront
- Minimal changes to existing workflow logic
- Clear separation of concerns
**Alternatives considered**:
- Mid-workflow switching (rejected: complex state management)
- Parallel workflows (rejected: code duplication)

### 3. Script Validation Requirements
**Decision**: Basic validation - non-empty, reasonable length limits, text format
**Rationale**:
- Keep it simple - most validation happens in downstream steps
- Trust user input for content quality
- Focus on technical validation only
**Alternatives considered**:
- Content quality analysis (rejected: out of scope)
- Format-specific validation (rejected: scripts are free-form text)

### 4. Data Storage Approach
**Decision**: Store uploaded scripts using existing script storage mechanism
**Rationale**:
- Reuse existing infrastructure
- No changes needed to downstream processing
- Consistent data model
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate upload storage (rejected: unnecessary complexity)
- In-memory processing only (rejected: need persistence for workflow)

### 5. Error Handling Patterns
**Decision**: Standard HTTP error responses with user-friendly messages
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing API patterns
- Clear feedback for upload failures
- Graceful degradation
**Alternatives considered**:
- Silent failure with retry (rejected: confusing UX)
- Complex error recovery (rejected: over-engineering)

## Implementation Approach

### Backend Changes
- Add script upload endpoint to existing API
- Extend workflow service to handle uploaded scripts
- Add validation middleware for script content
- Update workflow status tracking

### Frontend Changes
- Add workflow mode selection UI
- Create script upload component
- Integrate with existing workflow navigation
- Add upload progress feedback

### Integration Points
- Workflow orchestration service
- Script processing pipeline
- User session management
- Error reporting system

## Technical Constraints Resolved
- **Script size limits**: 50KB max (reasonable for text content)
- **Content type validation**: text/plain, UTF-8 encoding
- **Upload security**: Standard sanitization, no executable content
- **Concurrent uploads**: Standard FastAPI async handling
- **State management**: Use existing workflow state machine

## Risk Mitigation
- **Large file uploads**: Size limits prevent issues
- **Malicious content**: Basic sanitization, downstream validation
- **Workflow state corruption**: Atomic operations, rollback capability
- **UI complexity**: Progressive enhancement, clear user feedback

All technical unknowns have been resolved. Ready for Phase 1 design.
