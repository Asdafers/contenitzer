# Feature Specification: Script Upload Option

**Feature Branch**: `005-i-need-an`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I need an option to skip youtube research and script generation and instead to be able to provide a script I already have. All other steps should stay the same."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: script upload, skip research/generation, maintain workflow
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ No major clarifications needed for core concept
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: upload script instead of generating one
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec ready for planning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users who already have their own script content want to skip the YouTube research and script generation phases of the content creation process. They should be able to upload or input their existing script and proceed directly to the subsequent workflow steps (such as content optimization, formatting, or publishing).

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has an existing script, **When** they choose the "Upload Script" option, **Then** they can input their script content and bypass research/generation steps
2. **Given** a user uploads their script, **When** the system processes it, **Then** all subsequent workflow steps execute normally using the provided script
3. **Given** a user is in the content creation workflow, **When** they select script upload mode, **Then** YouTube research and script generation steps are completely skipped

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploaded script is empty or invalid format?
- How does system handle very large script uploads?
- What validation is performed on user-provided scripts?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an option to upload or input existing script content
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to skip YouTube research phase when script upload option is selected
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to skip script generation phase when script upload option is selected
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate uploaded script content for basic format requirements
- **FR-005**: System MUST continue with all subsequent workflow steps using the uploaded script
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve the uploaded script content throughout the workflow
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to choose between script generation and script upload at workflow start
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle script upload failures gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Script Content**: User-provided text content that replaces generated script, with attributes like content text, upload timestamp, and validation status
- **Workflow Mode**: Configuration setting that determines whether to use research/generation or script upload path
