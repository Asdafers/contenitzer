# Feature Specification: Custom Media Selection for Content Planning

**Feature Branch**: `011-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to add features that at the content planning stage will let me select image, video and music files to add to the list of generated ones. The complete set of selected and described files should then be used to generate video. Make sure both APIs and UI required to achieve this is delivered."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature involves file selection during content planning phase
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Content creators
   ’ Actions: Select files, add to generation list, use in video production
   ’ Data: Image files, video files, music files, descriptions
   ’ Constraints: Integration with existing content planning workflow
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: File size limits and supported formats?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: File storage location - user uploads or existing library?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are files associated with specific scenes/segments?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow from file selection to video generation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Custom media assets, selections, associations
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Multiple clarifications needed for complete specification
8. Return: WARN "Spec has uncertainties requiring clarification"
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator, I want to supplement AI-generated content with my own custom media files during the content planning stage, so that the final video can include both generated and curated assets that match my specific vision and brand requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am at the content planning stage with a script uploaded, **When** I view the generated content plan, **Then** I can see options to add my own image, video, and music files alongside the AI-generated assets

2. **Given** I have selected custom media files to include, **When** I review the complete asset list, **Then** I can see both AI-generated and custom assets with clear descriptions and intended usage

3. **Given** I have finalized a content plan with mixed custom and generated assets, **When** I proceed to video generation, **Then** the system incorporates all selected assets into the final video output

4. **Given** I want to replace an AI-generated asset with my own file, **When** I select a custom alternative, **Then** the system updates the plan to use my file instead of the generated one

### Edge Cases
- What happens when custom file formats are unsupported?
- How does the system handle files that are too large or exceed quality limits?
- What occurs if a selected custom file becomes unavailable during video generation?
- How does the system manage conflicting duration requirements between custom videos and planned segments?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to browse and select image files during content planning stage
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to browse and select video files during content planning stage
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to browse and select music/audio files during content planning stage
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to add descriptions or metadata to selected custom files
- **FR-005**: System MUST display both AI-generated and custom-selected assets in a unified content plan view
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to associate custom files with specific scenes or segments in their content plan
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate custom files for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: format compatibility, size limits, duration constraints?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST incorporate custom files into the video generation process alongside AI-generated content
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to replace AI-generated assets with custom alternatives
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve custom file selections when users modify other aspects of their content plan
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file upload capability or selection from existing library?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file storage and organization - per user, per project, global library?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Custom Media Asset**: Represents user-selected files (images, videos, audio) with metadata including file type, duration, description, and usage intent
- **Asset Selection**: Links custom media assets to specific content plan segments, including positioning and integration instructions
- **Enhanced Content Plan**: Extended version of existing content plans that includes both AI-generated and custom-selected assets with unified workflow
- **Media Library**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Collection of available custom files - user's personal library or shared repository?]
