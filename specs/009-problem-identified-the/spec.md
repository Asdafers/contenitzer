# Feature Specification: Real AI-Powered Media Generation

**Feature Branch**: `009-problem-identified-the`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Problem Identified

  The issue is clear: there is no actual LLM integration in the media generation process. The system
   is completing in subseconds because it's only creating placeholder files, not using any AI model
  for actual media generation.

  Here's what's happening:

  1. In media_tasks.py:96: The task calls video_service.asset_generator.generate_assets_for_job()
  2. In media_asset_generator.py: All the generation methods create placeholder files:
    - _create_placeholder_image() - Creates static colored images with text
    - _create_placeholder_audio() - Creates empty audio files
    - No LLM/AI calls whatsoever
  3. Model parameter is ignored: Despite the console showing model: gemini-2.5-flash, this parameter
   is passed through but never actually used for generation.
  4. Progress updates are fake: The progress events (15%, 35%, 60%, 100%) are hardcoded in
  media_tasks.py:79-85 and fire immediately since no real processing happens.

  The system needs actual Gemini integration for:
  - Image generation using Gemini's image generation capabilities
  - Script analysis using Gemini to understand scenes and generate appropriate prompts
  - Real processing time that reflects actual LLM API calls

  The model and allow_fallback parameters are correctly passed through the API chain but completely
  ignored in the actual asset generation logic at media_asset_generator.py:185-500."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator, I want the video generation system to use actual AI models to create meaningful visual and audio assets from my script content, so that I get high-quality generated videos instead of placeholder content, and I can see realistic progress updates that reflect the actual processing time required for AI generation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has uploaded a script and selected "gemini-2.5-flash" as their model, **When** they trigger media generation, **Then** the system should use the selected AI model to analyze the script content and generate appropriate visual assets based on the script's themes and content
2. **Given** the AI model is processing a script for media generation, **When** the user monitors progress, **Then** they should see realistic progress updates that correspond to actual AI processing stages (script analysis, prompt generation, image generation, etc.) rather than hardcoded fake progress percentages
3. **Given** the AI media generation process is running, **When** the process completes, **Then** the generated assets should be actual AI-created images and audio that relate to the script content, not placeholder files or static colored images

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the selected AI model is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does the system handle timeout scenarios when AI processing takes longer than expected?
- What fallback behavior occurs when AI generation fails but the user expects generated content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST utilize the selected AI model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Flash) for actual media asset generation when processing video scripts
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze script content using AI to understand themes, scenes, and visual requirements before generating assets
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate actual images using AI capabilities rather than creating static placeholder images
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide realistic progress tracking that reflects actual AI processing stages and timing
- **FR-005**: System MUST respect model selection parameters passed through the API and use them for generation
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate clear error messages when AI model failures occur, with no fallback behavior - all failures should be reported as errors to users for debugging purposes
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide detailed feedback to users about AI processing status including specific processing stages, error details, model responses, and processing times for debugging purposes
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate audio content using AI capabilities rather than creating empty placeholder files
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure generated assets are contextually relevant to the input script content

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Media Generation Request**: Contains script content, selected AI model, generation options, and user preferences
- **AI Processing Job**: Tracks the actual AI model execution, progress stages, and processing results
- **Generated Asset**: Represents AI-created media (images, audio) with metadata about generation method and AI model used
- **Progress Event**: Real-time updates about AI processing stages, completion percentages, and estimated time remaining
