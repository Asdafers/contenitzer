# Feature Specification: Frontend Components & Redis Scaling

**Feature Branch**: `003-we-now-need`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We now need to add - 1. Frontend: Implement the React components (currently just API client exists); 2. Scale: Add Redis for task queue and session management"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Content creators need a fully functional web interface to create YouTube videos through an automated workflow. Currently, they can only interact with the system via API calls, but they need visual components to upload content, track progress, configure settings, and manage their video projects through an intuitive user interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a content creator visits the application, **When** they access the main workflow page, **Then** they see visual components for trending analysis, script generation, media creation, video composition, and YouTube upload
2. **Given** a user initiates content analysis, **When** the system processes their request, **Then** they see real-time progress updates and can track the status of each workflow step
3. **Given** multiple users are using the system simultaneously, **When** they perform intensive operations like video processing, **Then** the system handles concurrent requests without performance degradation
4. **Given** a user's session is interrupted, **When** they return to the application, **Then** their workflow progress is preserved and they can continue from where they left off

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user closes their browser during video processing?
- How does the system handle network interruptions during file uploads?
- What occurs when multiple users attempt to process videos simultaneously?
- How are user sessions managed across browser restarts?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide visual components for YouTube trending analysis with category selection and progress indicators
- **FR-002**: System MUST display script generation interface with input options for automated, manual topic, or complete script entry
- **FR-003**: System MUST show media generation progress with preview capabilities for generated audio and visual assets
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide video composition interface with timeline view and quality controls
- **FR-005**: System MUST offer YouTube upload management with metadata editing and upload progress tracking
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain user session state across browser refreshes and network interruptions
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle concurrent user requests without blocking or performance degradation
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide real-time progress updates for all long-running operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to configure API keys and preferences through a settings interface
- **FR-010**: System MUST display project history and allow users to manage multiple video projects
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle task queuing for resource-intensive operations like video processing
- **FR-012**: System MUST support session persistence across user logouts and browser restarts

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Session**: Represents active user state, preferences, and current workflow progress
- **Task Queue**: Manages background processing jobs with priority, status, and progress tracking
- **UI Component State**: Maintains form data, user inputs, and interface state across interactions
- **Progress Tracker**: Records real-time status updates for multi-step workflows
- **User Configuration**: Stores user preferences, API keys, and application settings
