# Feature Specification: Upgrade to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Model

**Feature Branch**: `007-https-aistudio-google`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "https://aistudio.google.com/models/gemini-2-5-flash-image read through this page and make sure we are using this model for generating ALL the images and videos"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Focus on upgrading to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model for all visual content
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Content creators, system administrators
   ’ Actions: Model upgrade, image generation, video generation
   ’ Data: Visual assets, generation configurations
   ’ Constraints: Must use latest Gemini model for ALL visual content
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: API endpoint and pricing details not available from referenced URL]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Test image generation quality and performance improvements
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must ensure consistent model usage
6. Identify Key Entities (configuration, generation jobs)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN: Spec has uncertainties about API details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a content creator using the video generation platform, I want all images and videos to be generated using Google's latest Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model so that I get the best quality visual content with improved performance and capabilities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I request video generation with background images, **When** the system generates visual assets, **Then** all images are created using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model
2. **Given** I create a new video project, **When** the system generates video clips and backgrounds, **Then** all visual content uses the latest Gemini model consistently
3. **Given** existing projects are being regenerated, **When** I request asset updates, **Then** the system automatically uses the new model version
4. **Given** I check generation metadata, **When** I view asset details, **Then** the system shows "gemini-2.5-flash-image" as the generation model

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the new model is temporarily unavailable?
- How does system handle projects created with older models?
- What occurs if API quotas are exceeded for the new model?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model for all new image generation requests
- **FR-002**: System MUST use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model for all new video background generation
- **FR-003**: System MUST update configuration to specify the exact model version "gemini-2.5-flash-image"
- **FR-004**: System MUST track which model version was used for each generated asset
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide fallback behavior when the preferred model is unavailable
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate model availability before starting generation jobs
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to see which model version generated their content
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure consistent model usage across all image and video generation workflows

*Marked unclear requirements:*
- **FR-009**: System MUST authenticate with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific API endpoint and authentication method for Gemini 2.5 Flash Image not confirmed from source URL]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: pricing model and rate limits for new Gemini version not specified]

### Key Entities
- **Generation Job**: Video/image generation request that must specify model version
- **Asset Metadata**: Tracks which model version generated each visual asset
- **Model Configuration**: System settings defining which Gemini model to use for different content types
- **Fallback Strategy**: Rules for handling model unavailability or errors
